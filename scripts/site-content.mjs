    repo: "https://github.com/specula-org/tlaps-bench",
    overview:
      "TLAPS proofs are checked mechanically by tlapm: a proof is either accepted or " +
      "rejected, with no partial credit and no room for a plausible-but-wrong argument. " +
      "Each task presents a TLA+ theorem whose proof body is replaced by PROOF OBVIOUS; " +
      "the AI must replace it with a real proof that tlapm accepts. That makes proof " +
      "construction a sharp test of an AI's formal reasoning.",
  },

      blurb: "The full scaffolding is given, including inductive invariants, lemma " +
             "decomposition, and preceding lemmas marked PROOF OMITTED, and the AI fills " +
             "in one target proof." },
    { id: "scratch", name: "--mode proof-from-scratch", full: "--mode proof-from-scratch",
      cli: "--mode proof-from-scratch",
      blurb: "Only the model and the target theorem statement remain; the AI must invent " +
             "the entire proof structure, including any helper lemmas." },
