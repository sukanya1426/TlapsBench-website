    overview:
      "TLAPS proofs are checked mechanically by tlapm: a proof is either accepted or " +
      "rejected, with no partial credit and no room for a plausible-but-wrong argument. " +
      "Each property presents a TLA+ theorem whose proof body is replaced by PROOF OBVIOUS; " +
      "the AI must replace it with a real proof that tlapm accepts. That makes proof " +
      "construction a sharp test of an AI's formal reasoning.",
